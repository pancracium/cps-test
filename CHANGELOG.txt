v1.0:

- Published the program.

v1.1:

- Now floats (numbers with floating point) can also be used a duration for the test.

- Added two new files: CHANGELOG.txt and TODO.txt

- Added a click sound (therefore also added the click.wav file).

- Made sure the inserted duration value is a positive number.

- Changed the name of the self.clicks variable to self.click_count, because ChadGPT said it wasn't clear enough.
