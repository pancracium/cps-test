v1.0:

- Published the program.

v1.1:

- Now floats (numbers with floating point) can also be used a duration for the test.

- Added two new files: CHANGELOG.txt and TODO.txt

- Added a click sound (therefore also added the click.wav file).

- Made sure the inserted duration value is a positive number.

- Changed the name of the self.clicks variable to self.click_count, because ChadGPT said it wasn't clear enough. (I only use it to ask how to improve my code and so).

v1.2:

- Added awards, which you can get by reaching certain amount of CPS: Normal clicker, fast clicker, jitter clicker, butterfly clicker, real butterfly clicker,
drag clicker, bolt clicker and autoclicker.

- Added the missing docstring and comments to the change_update_delay() method.

- Changed the description to a clearer one, adding empty lines, bullet points and so.

- Added more thing to do in the TODO.txt file.

- Added the awards.json file, to save the gained awards and load then later.
